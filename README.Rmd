# jsonGraphTemplates

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

jsonGraphTemplates allows to define templates for R graphs, using json -- a human readable format (for certain values of "human"). These templates are primarily meant to be used with GCDkit (<http://gcdkit.org>), although the aim is to also supply parsers to use them in ggplot and, to a point, in base R (they will never be very good in base R, that lacks the more advanced functionalities in paticular of calculating combinations of variables).

## Installation

The easiest way to install jsonGraphTemplates for now is from a local zip (or gz) file:

``` r
install.packages("jsonGraphTemplates",repo=NULL)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GCDkit)
library(jsonGraphTemplates)

 data("atacazo")
 accessVar("atacazo")

plotDiagram_json("TASMiddlemostVolc.json")
```
<img src="man/figures/example_graph.png" width="100%" />
